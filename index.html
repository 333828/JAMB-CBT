    <br><h1>How To Answer JAMB CBT Exam Questions And Score High</h1>
    <br><br>
      <p>Not everyone knows how to answer JAMB CBT exam questions. Many candidates often prepare well for examinations
        and still end up disappointing themselves because they were not informed on how best to approach the JAMB CBT
        exam questions and answer them. In this post, we would like to guide you on how to approach and answer JAMB
        CBT Exam questions and come out in flying colours.</p>
      <p>Now, let's proceed to look at how to approach and answer JAMB CBT exam questions. The points will be broken 
        down into bits for easy understanding.
      </p>
    <h2>How To Answer JAMB CBT Exam Questions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><h4>Read the instruction carefully</h4></li>
      <p>To answer any question correctly, you need to first understand the questions. Once you are seated in the front
        of your computer system, you may be required to type in your JAMB Registration Number. Once you have done this,
        the instructions will be shown to you. Ensure your read through the instuction and have a clear understanding 
        of what is required of you before you proceed to start your exam. Every instruction given to you by the 
        invigilator as well as the instructions on your computer screen should be followed strictly.
      </p>
      <p>After  you have entered your Registrationnamber the details which you provided during your JAMB registration will
         be auto-generated and shown on the screen. These details may include your name, passport, subjects you will be 
         writing. Ensure all of these details are correct and match your own details before proceeding to answer the 
         questions to avoid losing your result to someone else. If there is anything thhta is not in order, please do 
         call the attention of the invigilator.</p>
    <li><h4>Plan how much time you will spend on each of the subjects:</h4></li>
      <p>In JAMB CBT examination, speed and accuracy is very important. You have 2 hours to answer 180 questions. You do no
         need to spend too much time on a question. It will do you good to even share the time among the questions so you 
         determine the maximum time you are to spend on a question to avoid spending unnecesary time on a question. 
         <br>Let me help you with that.<br>
        JAMB Questions = 180 <br>
        Time = 2hrs <br>
        English = 60 Questions, Time = 40 mins<br>
        2nd Subjects = 40 Questions, Time = 27 mins<br>
        3rd Subjects = 40 Questions, Time = 27 mins<br>
        4th Subjects = 40 Questions, Time = 26 mins<br></p>
     <p>That means you should spend am average of 40 seconds on one questions. If possible, answer the questions as they come
        (you wil only be able to see one question on the screen at a time) because you may not have all the time to go back to 
        any questions you may not have answered correctly to see if there are changes to be made. Remember that once your time 
        is up, the computer the computer will shut down by itself and submit your answers automatically. A computer is not like
        a human you will tell, "Please sir, just two more minutes".
     </p>
    <li><h4>You understand the queston before you pick your option</h4></li>
      <p>Don't simply jump into picking your answerss during the jamb exam. Take the first coupke of seconds to understand the 
      question before choosing an option as your ansswer. JAMB can be quite tricky in their questions. Look out for tricky 
      questions with similar answers especially in use of English, many questions you approach will look quite simple and the 
      answer may seem so obvious but in most cases,that is noy actually the case. Now on rule I am going to give you concerning 
      JAMB CBT exam is  this: If the questions sound too simple and answer seems to easy and obvious, take a second look at the 
      question. I repeat JAMB is very tricky. So, understand the question before you pick your answer. 
      </p>
    <li><h4>Start with the subject you know best or more comfortable with</h4></li>
      <p>It is always advisable to start Use of English paper and then proceed to another subject you know best. However, it is not 
        a must. You can start with any subject you are more comfortable with. The reason you to start with the subject you are more
        comfortable with and equally help you save time for the difficult ones. 
      </p>
    <li><h4>Question that Requires more brain work</h4></li>
      <p>Obviously some questions or subjects may require more brainwork than others especially the ones that involve calculations 
        or logical reasoning. Even at that, do not spend unnecessary time trying to answer a question. After answering all questions   
        and there is still time, you can always come back to attempt any question you may have jumped. So if the question seem to be 
        taken more time than expected, look at the options and check if you have gotten enough information from your calculations and 
        reasoning as the the case may be to infer an answer. If you have, please choose the most logical answer and proceed.
      </p>
    <li><h4>Attempt All Questions - Answer All Questions</h4></li>
      <p>Whatever you do, try and answer all questions. This will increase your chances of scoring high in examination. Forget about 
        negative marking. Practically there is nothing like that in JAMB CBT Exam. So, make sure you provide an answer to a question, 
        whether you are sure of the answers or not. If you are not sure, guess logically or go with your instinct or intuition.</p>
    <li><h4>Guess logically using Elimination Method</h4></li>
      <p>Since the questions are multiple-choice questions, even if you do not know thw answers to the question, you can apply the
         elimination method. Ather going through the available options, If you prepared like you should for exam, you will likely
          discover one or two options that will never be the correct answer to the question. Eliminate them and work with the remaining
          options.</p>
      <p>This is similar to the 50:50 lifeline in the "Who wants to be a millionaire" television program where the computer takes away 
        two incorrect options and leaves two two options - one being the correct answer and the otheran incorrect option. This will 
        increase your chances of choosing the correct answer. Remember it is better to choose and possibly be right than to leave blank 
        and not have any chances at all.</p>
